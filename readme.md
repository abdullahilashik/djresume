# Django Digital Resume

Digital resume developed using Django framework. Template is collected from online free template providers. This resume is completely controlled via sqlite3 database through admin panel. You can either add or remove any information to it. It's easily customizable and open for anyone to use.

This is open for anyone to use but make sure you keep the developer name and dont' change it please. This will encourage me to bring more useful projects for everyone to use.

#### This project covers below subjects

- Class Based Views

**N.B.:** This project is intended for education purpose use only. Please do not use this to submit for your institute's project submission. That will only prevent you from learning the beauty of Django. Feel free to clone this, practice and learn. Do some modifications yourself so that you can learn something and move on to advanced level.
